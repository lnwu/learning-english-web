# Example Terraform variables file
# Copy this to terraform.tfvars and fill in your actual values
# NEVER commit terraform.tfvars with real credentials to git

# Google Cloud Configuration
gcp_project_id = "your-gcp-project-id"
gcp_region     = "us-central1"

# GitHub Configuration
github_repo = "lnwu/learning-english"

# Vercel Configuration
# Get these from: https://vercel.com/account/tokens
vercel_token        = "your-vercel-api-token"
vercel_org_id       = "your-vercel-org-id"
vercel_project_id   = "your-vercel-project-id"

# ============================================================================
# Application Secrets (AUTH, Firebase, etc.) are NOW managed differently:
# ============================================================================
# Instead of adding them here, they are stored encrypted in secrets.enc.yaml
# 
# Steps to manage application secrets:
# 1. Copy secrets.yaml.example to secrets.yaml
# 2. Fill in your actual values (AUTH_SECRET, OAuth credentials, Firebase config)
# 3. Encrypt with SOPS: sops --encrypt secrets.yaml > secrets.enc.yaml
# 4. Delete secrets.yaml (unencrypted)
# 5. Commit secrets.enc.yaml to git
# 
# Benefits:
# - Secrets are version controlled (encrypted)
# - Easy to rotate and update
# - Team members can view/edit with proper KMS permissions
# - Only 3 GitHub Secrets needed (GCP, Vercel credentials)
